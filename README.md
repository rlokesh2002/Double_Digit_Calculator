Double Digit Calculator | Digital Electronic Circuits (Sep 2021 – Sep 2021)
•  Designed a PCB model of an automated non-ALU Double-Digit Calculator Digital Circuit in Circuit Maker
•  Utilized PIPO registers to take input: two-digit number, + or –, two-digit number and = from a single ASCII keypad
•  Converted the input numbers from BCD to binary and evaluated the operation on the binary equivalents
•  Implemented Double Dabble Algorithm using minimum basic ICs to convert the binary result to BCD equivalent
•  Handled all cases of + and - operations to span the result range from -99 to 198 shown on three CA 7-seg displays
